    "## 1.  Linear shift-invariant systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A __linear__ system is one which obeys the principle of superposition: the response to a weighted sum of any two inputs is the weighted sum of the responses to each individual input. \n",
    "\n",
    "A __shift invariant__ system is one for which the response to an input shifted by an amount $\\Delta$ is equal to the response to the original input shifted by $\\Delta$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A __linear shift-invariant system__ (LSI) is therefore one which produces linear, shifted outputs for any linear, shifted input. In other words, the system is __insensitive to time__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a discrete input signal $\\vec{x}$. As before, we can view it as a __weighted sum of impulses__ (also called \"delta functions\"). Since the system is linear, the response to this weighted sum is just weighted sum of the responses to each individual inpulse. Since the system is shift-invariant, the response to each impulse is just a __shifted copy__ of the response to the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response to the impulse located at position 0 is known as the system's __impulse response__. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the system is the weighted sum of shifted copies of the impulse response. We need only measure this impulse response to compute the response of the system to any input.\n",

    "## 2.  Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe the computation performed by the LSI as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = \\sum_{k} r(n-k) x(k)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the current time step, $k$ is the number of time steps in the past, and $r$ is the the impulse response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as __convolving__ $x$ with $r$. In compact notation, we write: $y = x * r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src='img/convolution.png'width=\"300\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is __commutative__; substituting $k = n - m$, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = \\sum_{k} r(k) x(n-k)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The impulse response $r$ is known as a __convolution kernel__ or linear filter. Each component of the output $y$ is computed as the dot product of a section of the input vector $x$ with a _reversed copy_ of $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution works by summing over the dot products of the inputs of the past $k$ time steps with the _reversed_ impulse responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we can think of convolution as a __sliding dot product__ of the reversed impulse response $r$ over a window of the vector $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, we can think of it as a __matrix__ in which each __column__ is the __impulse response__ shifted down by one component. Each __row__ is therefore the __reversed impulse response__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operation can be generalised to multidimensional signals. For example, in 2D, the signal and convolution kernel are both two-dimensional arrays of numbers, and the operation corresponds to taking sums over a 2D window of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.  Discrete sinusoids\n",
    "\n",
    "A __discrete sinusoidal signal__ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "x(n) = A \\cos(\\omega n - \\phi) \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is an integer position within the signal, $A$ is the __amplitude__ of the sinusoid, $\\omega$ is the __frequency__ of oscillation in _radians per sample_, $\\phi$ is the __phase__ in radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the trigonometric identity $\\cos(a - b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) + \\sin(a)\\sin(b)$, we can state that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "A \\cos(\\omega n - \\phi) = A \\cos (\\phi) \\cos (\\omega n) + A \\sin (\\phi) sin (\\omega n)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$A \\cos(\\phi)$ and $A \\sin(\\phi)$ can be seen as __weights__ or __amplitudes__ of cosine and sine waves, respectively. This means that the vector of $A \\cos(\\omega n - \\phi)$ can be traced out by a weighted sum of the vectors for $\\cos(\\omega n)$ and $\\sin(\\omega n)$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In brief, any sinusoidal waveform can be reconstructed with a __weighted sum of cosine and sine__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that any _shifted_ and _scaled_ sinusoidal vector can be written as a weighted sum of _two fixed_ sine and cosine vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can express the co-ordinates of the vector $A \\cos(\\omega n - \\phi)$ at any given time step $n$ in either rectangular or polar forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "x = A \\cos (\\phi) \\;, \\; \\; y = A \\sin (\\phi) \\\\\n",
    "A = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\;, \\; \\; \\phi = \\tan^{-1}(y/x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.1  LSI response to sinusoids \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sinosoidal functions have a unique behaviour with respect to LSI systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the input signal $x(n) = \\cos(\\omega n)$. Passing it through an LSI with impulse response $r(n)$ will yield an output $y(n)$ which is a shifted, scaled version of the original sinusoidal input:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = \\sum_{k} r(k) x(n - k)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = \\sum_{k} r(k) \\; \\cos(\\omega(n - k))\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Run forwards through the impulse response, and backwards through the input signal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same trigonometric identity as before, we can break down $y(n)$ as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = \\sum_{k} r(k) [\\cos(\\omega n) \\; \\cos (\\omega k)  + \\sin(\\omega k)  \\sin(\\omega n)]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = \\sum_{k} r(k) \\; \\cos(\\omega n) \\; \\cos (\\omega k)  + \\sum_{k} r(k) \\; \\sin(\\omega k)  \\sin(\\omega n) \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum over $k$ of $r(k)\\cos(\\omega m)$ and $r(k)\\sin(\\omega m)$ are just constants, the dot products of the impulse resonse with the cosine and sine functions at frequency $\\omega$. We can denote them as $C_r(\\omega)$ and $S_r(\\omega)$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = C_r(\\omega) \\cos (\\omega n)  + S_r(\\omega) \\sin(\\omega m) \n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $C_r(w)$ measures how similar the impulse is to a cosine wave, and $S_r(w)$ measures how similar the impulse is to a sine wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can re-write this using polar co-ordinates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = A_r(\\omega) \\cos(\\phi_r(\\omega)) \\cos(\\omega n)\n",
    "+ A_r(w)\\sin(\\phi_r(\\omega)) \\sin(\\omega n)\n",
    "\\end{equation*} \n",
    "\n",
    "Which can be simplified using the same trigonometric identity as before:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = A_r(\\omega) \\cos (\\omega n - \\phi_r (\\omega))\n",
    "\\end{equation*} \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the response of an LSI system to a sinusoidal input is a __sinosoid of the same frequency__, but of possibly __different amplitude and phase__. This means that, no matter what cosine wave you put into the system, the output will remain in the hyperplane spanned by that cosine wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, if the input has amplitude $A_x$ and phase $\\phi_x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "x(n) = A_x \\cos(\\omega n - \\phi_x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*} \n",
    "\n",
    "Then linearity and shift-invariance tell us that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(n) = A_x A_r(\\omega) \\cos(\\omega n - \\phi_x - \\phi_r(\\omega))\n",
    "\\end{equation*} \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the __amplitude of the input__ $A_x$ and the amplitude of the response $A_r(\\omega)$ __multiply__, while the __phase of the input__ $\\phi_x$ and the phase of the response $\\phi_r(\\omega)$ __add__. \n",
    "\n",
    "All this is a function of __frequency__, $\\omega$. When you represent an input vector as a weighted sum of sine and cosine waves of different frequencies and pass it through the LSI, the LSI treats all those frequencies __independently__. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Fourier transform__ is the transformation of a signal as a _function of time_ to a set of coefficients which capture the _amount of each sinusoidal frequency_ present in the signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will construct the __Discrete Fourier Transform__ (DFT), which is periodic and discrete in both the signal and transform domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider an input vector of length $N$, which represents one period of a _periodic discrete input signal_. We can construct an __orthogonal matrix__ with $N$ rows and $k$ columns containing pairs of sine and cosine of frequencies $2 \\pi k / N$ for each column $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "c_k(n) \\equiv \\cos(\\frac{2 \\pi k}{N} n), \\; \\; k = 0, 1, \\cdots \\frac{N}{2} \\\\\n",
    "s_k(n) \\equiv \\sin(\\frac{2 \\pi k}{N} n), \\; \\; k = 1, 2, \\cdots \\frac{N}{2} - 1\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this the __Fourier matrix__, $F$, and can visualise it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src='img/FT_matrix.png'width=\"500\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this set of $N$ sinusoidal vectors are orthogonal to each other, they __span the full input space__, and we can write any vector $\\vec{x}$ as a weighted sum of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "x[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N/2} a_k C_k[n] +  \\sum_{k=0}^{N/2 - 1} b_k S_k[n]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a_k$ and $b_k$ are the __Fourier coefficients__.  Since the basis is orthogonal, they can be computed by projecting the input vector $\\vec{x}$ onto each basis function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "a_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] C_k[n] \\\\\n",
    "b_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] S_k[n]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can combine the cosine and sine terms into a single phase-shifted sinusoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "x[n] = \\sum_{k=0}^{N/2} A_k \\sin \\; (\\frac{2 \\pi k}{N} n - \\phi_k)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "With amplitudes $A_k = \\sqrt{a_k^2 + b_k^2}$ and phases $\\phi_k = \\tan^{-1} (b_k / a_k)$. These are referred to as the __Fourier amplitudes__ and __Fourier phases__ of the signal $x[n]$. It's simply a polar representation of the original values $\\{a_k, b_k\\}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, applying the matrix $F$ to an input vector $\\vec{x}$ performs a generalised _rotation_ of that vector, representing it in a new set of coordinate axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Convolution theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important property of the Fourier representation is its relationship to LSI systems and convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we must represent the Fourier coefficients using a complex-valued number, $A_k e^{i \\phi k}$. The Fourier __amplitudes__ and __phases__ correspond to the amplitude and phase of this complex number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we consider applying a LSI system to an arbitrary signal, $x$. We apply the Fourier transform to this signal - $F^Tx$ - to re-write it as a weighted sum of sinosoids of different frequencies, where the weights are the Fourier coefficients $C_r$ and $S_r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights may be expressed as complex numbers, $A_k e^{i \\phi k}$, representing the amplitude and phase of each sinusoidal component. Since the system is linear, the response to this weighted sum is just the __weighted sum of responses to each individual sinosoid__. \n",
    "\n",
    "The action of an LSI on a sinusoid with frequency $k$ wil be to scale the amplitude by $A_r(k)$ and shift the phase by $\\phi_r(k)$. So, the system response is a sum of sinosoids with amplitudes and phases corresponding to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "(A_r(k) A_k)e^{i(\\phi_r(k) + \\phi_k)} = (A_r(k)e^{i\\phi_r(k)})(A_k e^{i \\phi_k})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, by understanding what the LSI system does to each sinusoid of frequency $k$, we can understand what it will do to any input. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "<img src='img/fourier_LSI.png'width=\"500\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the relationship between the __impulse response__ characterisation of LSI systems, and this __complex number__ characterisation? \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we write an expression for the response of the LSI system in terms of convolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y[n] = \\sum_{m} r[m] x[n - m]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "We then take the __Discrete Fourier Transform__ of both sides of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Y[k] = \\sum_{n} y[n] e^{i 2\\pi n k / N} \\\\\n",
    "= \\sum_{n} \\sum_{m} r[m] x[n-m] e^{i 2\\pi n k / N} \\\\\n",
    "= \\sum_{m} r[m] \\sum_{n} x[n-m] e^{i 2\\pi n k / N} \\\\\n",
    "= \\sum_{m} r[m] e^{i 2\\pi n k / N} X[k] \\\\\n",
    "= R[k] X[k]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the __DFT of the LSI system response__, $y[n]$, is just the product of the __DFT of the input and the DFT of the impulse response__. That is, the complex numbers $A_k e^{i \\phi k}$ correspond to Fourier transform of $r[n]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the response of the LSI system may be computed by:\n",
    "- performing a Fourier transform on the __input signal__\n",
    "- multiplying each Fourier coefficient by the associated Fourier coefficient of the __impulse response__\n",
    "- performing an inverse Fourier transform - which corresponds to recombining the sinusoids - to yield the __output signal__\n",
    "\n",
    "This is otherwise known as the __convolution theorem__: _\"convolution in the signal domain corresponds to multiplication in the Fourier domain\"_.\n",
